This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The algorithms and techniques used and developed here will later be re-used in a machine-learning assignment with regard to local climate change as a function of atmospheric particulate content.

For the first project in Exploratory Data Analysis, we need to reproduce the four plots in the figure folder.

The reproducted plots are stored in plots.

## This repository contains four R language plot programs

. plot1.R
. plot2.R
. plot3.R
. plot4.R

## and the corresponding PNG graphics files
